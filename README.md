# VOYAGE - A SECURE MESSAGING APP

--- 

## Application Description

This messenger application, named <strong> "Voyage," </strong> was developed as a part of <strong> CS4203 - Computer Security </strong>. It was built using Express and .js, with the assistance of middlewares such as Passport for authentication purposes. MongoDB is used for storing user and data information.

## Running the Application

To run the application, you can try it on "https://voyagemessenger.herokuapp.com/" (but beware they will not sign in as I removed the api's from the code for security purposes) or  you can download the application ( use your own api's) and try it on your local host.

## Features

The application uses <strong> OAuth  </strong> to verify users and automatically creates a profile for them, if one does not exist already. Upon successful login, the chat icon is located on the left side of the screen, allowing users to chat with anyone registered on the application.

For simplicity, users have the option to log in using their Facebook or Google accounts.

<em> We hope you enjoy using Voyage! </em>
