# Voyage - A Secure Messaging App

## Description
Voyage is a secure messaging application that was created as part of CS4203 - Computer Security. It is built using Express and .js, with the help of middlewares such as Passport for authentication purposes. MongoDB is used for storing user and data informatio.


## Features
The application uses OAuth to verify users and automatically creates a profile for them if one does not exist already. Upon successful login, the chat icon is located on the left side of the screen, allowing users to chat with anyone registered on the application. For simplicity, users have the option to log in using their Facebook or Google accounts.

## Installation
To run the application, you can try it on the deployed version at [https://voyagemessenger.herokuapp.com/] (no longer in use) or you can download the application and try it on your local host. Please note that sign-ins may not work on the deployed version as the APIs have been removed from the code for security purposes.

## Usage
After logging in, you can use the chat icon on the left side of the screen to start messaging with anyone registered on the application.
